# ðŸš§ Development Server Issue - Status Update

## Issue Summary
The development server is encountering import resolution issues with health monitoring files that are preventing the core StayBoost app from running.

## Resolved âœ…
- âœ… Database migration completed successfully 
- âœ… All 8 tables created (ABTest, PopupSchedule, PopupFrequencyTracking, PopupTranslation + existing tables)
- âœ… Prisma client generated and ready
- âœ… Development environment configured
- âœ… JSX syntax error fixed in frequency controls

## Current Issue ðŸš¨
**Problem**: Module resolution errors with health monitoring system
- `Cannot find module '~/db.server'` and `~/utils/health.server'`
- Route collisions with disabled health files
- Vite caching causing old import paths to persist

## Temporary Solution Applied ðŸ”§
**Health monitoring features temporarily disabled:**
- âœ… `app/utils/health.server.js` â†’ `.disabled`
- âœ… `app/utils/sentry.server.js` â†’ `.disabled`  
- âœ… All health route files â†’ `.disabled`

These are advanced monitoring features not required for core functionality.

## Core App Status ðŸŽ¯
**StayBoost Core Features (Ready for Development):**
- âœ… Main dashboard: `app/routes/app._index.jsx`
- âœ… Settings API: `app/routes/api.stayboost.settings.jsx`
- âœ… Database models: `app/models/popupSettings.server.js`
- âœ… Theme extension: `extensions/stayboost-theme/`
- âœ… Popup JavaScript: `extensions/stayboost-theme/assets/stayboost-popup.js`

## Next Steps ðŸš€
1. **Clear Vite cache** to resolve import issues
2. **Test core app functionality** (dashboard, popup settings)
3. **Verify theme extension** works with storefront
4. **Begin Phase 2 implementation** (API endpoints)

## Phase 1 Achievement Summary âœ¨
- **Database Schema**: Complete with all advanced features
- **File Structure**: 10 new files created with 345+ TODOs
- **Migration Status**: All migrations applied successfully
- **Development Tools**: Prisma Studio running on :5555

**The foundation is solid!** The health monitoring system can be re-enabled later once the core app is working.

## Commands to Try Next
```bash
# Clear Vite cache and restart
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev

# If that fails, clear all caches
rm -rf node_modules/.vite dist .turbo
npm run dev
```

## Priority Focus 
**Core StayBoost functionality first, advanced monitoring later.**
