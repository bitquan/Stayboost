## üé® Design Best Practices

### **Visual Hierarchy**
1. **Headline** (largest, most important)
2. **Offer details** (clear, specific)
3. **Call-to-action button** (prominent, contrasting color)
4. **Fine print** (smallest, but readable)

### **Color Psychology**
- **Red**: Urgency, excitement, clearance sales
- **Blue**: Trust, professionalism, premium products
- **Green**: Money savings, eco-friendly, health products
- **Orange**: Fun, energy, call-to-action buttons
- **Purple**: Luxury, beauty, premium brands

### **Typography Guidelines**
- **Headlines**: 24-32px on desktop, 20-24px on mobile
- **Body text**: 16-18px minimum for readability
- **Button text**: 16-18px, bold weight
- **Contrast**: Always ensure text is easily readable

### **Mobile-Specific Design**
- **Larger touch targets**: Buttons 44px+ tall
- **Simplified content**: Fewer words, bigger impact
- **Thumb-friendly placement**: Buttons easy to reach
- **Fast loading**: Optimized images and minimal content

## ‚è∞ Timing Optimization

### **Display Timing**
- **Immediate (0 seconds)**: Can feel aggressive, use sparingly
- **2-3 seconds**: Sweet spot for most stores
- **5+ seconds**: Good for content-heavy pages
- **Scroll-based**: Trigger after 50% page scroll

### **Time-of-Day Patterns**
- **Morning (6-10 AM)**: Mobile-heavy, quick decisions
- **Lunch (11 AM-2 PM)**: Desktop browsing, research mode
- **Evening (6-10 PM)**: Peak shopping time, higher conversions
- **Late night (10 PM+)**: Impulse purchases, emotional buying

### **Day-of-Week Optimization**
- **Monday-Thursday**: Consistent performance
- **Friday-Saturday**: Higher conversion rates
- **Sunday**: Often best mobile performance
- **Payday patterns**: Mid-month and month-end spikes

### **Mobile Content Strategy**
