# üìä Analytics & Performance Guide

Understanding your popup performance is key to maximizing conversions and revenue. This guide shows you how to read and optimize your StayBoost analytics.

## üéØ Dashboard Overview

Your StayBoost analytics dashboard shows four key metrics:

### üìà Primary Metrics

#### 1. **Impressions**
- **What it is**: Number of times your popup was shown
- **Good range**: Varies by traffic, but should increase over time
- **What to watch**: Sudden drops might indicate technical issues

#### 2. **Conversions**
- **What it is**: Number of people who used your discount code
- **Good range**: 3-7% of impressions (industry average)
- **What to watch**: Low conversion rates may need template optimization

#### 3. **Conversion Rate**
- **What it is**: Conversions √∑ Impressions √ó 100
- **Good range**: 
  - 3-5%: Average performance
  - 5-7%: Good performance  
  - 7%+: Excellent performance
- **What to watch**: This is your most important metric

#### 4. **Revenue**
- **What it is**: Total sales attributed to popup conversions
- **Good range**: Should exceed your StayBoost subscription cost
- **What to watch**: Tracks your actual ROI

## üì± Mobile vs Desktop Performance

### Why This Matters
- 60%+ of ecommerce traffic is mobile
- Mobile and desktop users behave differently
- Different optimization strategies needed

### Key Differences
- **Mobile**: Typically higher conversion rates (easier to trigger)
- **Desktop**: Usually higher order values
- **Combined**: Best overall performance comes from optimizing both

## üé® Template Performance Comparison

### Built-in Analytics
StayBoost tracks performance for each template:
- **Classic Exit Intent**: Usually 5-7% conversion rate
- **Urgency Templates**: Often 6-8% conversion rate
- **Holiday Templates**: Can spike to 10%+ during seasons
- **Newsletter Signup**: Lower conversion (3-5%) but builds email list

### Template Optimization Tips
1. **Test seasonal templates** during holidays
2. **Rotate templates monthly** to avoid banner blindness
3. **A/B test** your top 2-3 performing templates
4. **Monitor mobile performance** separately

## üìÖ Time-Based Analytics

### Daily Patterns
- **Peak hours**: Usually match your normal traffic peaks
- **Weekends**: Often see different conversion patterns
- **Mobile spikes**: Evenings and weekends typically higher mobile traffic

### Weekly Trends
- **Monday-Thursday**: Usually consistent performance
- **Friday-Sunday**: Often higher conversion rates
- **Paydays**: Mid-month and month-end often see spikes

### Monthly Analysis
- **Month 1**: Establishing baseline performance
- **Month 2-3**: Optimization and improvement phase
- **Month 3+**: Consistent performance with seasonal variations

## üéØ Performance Optimization

### If Conversion Rate is Low (Under 3%)

#### Quick Fixes
1. **Check popup timing**: Try 2-3 second delay instead of instant
2. **Improve offer**: Increase discount percentage or add free shipping
3. **Simplify message**: Clear, concise value proposition
4. **Test different template**: Classic Exit Intent usually performs well

#### Advanced Optimization
1. **A/B test headlines**: Test 3-4 different popup titles
2. **Test offers**: Compare percentage discounts vs. free shipping
3. **Mobile optimization**: Ensure popup looks great on small screens
4. **Targeting rules**: Show different popups to new vs. returning visitors

### If Conversion Rate is Good (5%+) But Revenue is Low

#### Possible Issues
1. **Low-value discount codes**: People use code but don't complete purchase
2. **Discount too high**: High conversion but low profit margins
3. **Wrong audience**: Converting visitors who would have bought anyway

#### Solutions
1. **Add minimum purchase requirements**: "$50 minimum for 15% off"
2. **Test smaller discounts**: Sometimes 10% converts as well as 20%
3. **Promote higher-value items**: Link to collections instead of single products
4. **Add urgency**: "Limited time" or "While supplies last"

## üîç Advanced Analytics Features
